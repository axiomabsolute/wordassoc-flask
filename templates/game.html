            <p>Welcome to the word association game!</p>
            <p>  We're going to walk you through an example question so you know what to expect.</p>
        </li>
        <li data-id="question" data-text="Next">
            <p>A word, phrase, or snippet of code will show up here.</p>
        </li>
        <li data-id="answers" data-text="Next">
            <p>You'll select the word over here that is most associated with it.</p>
            <p>Since <code>if</code> statements are used to check logic an execute some block of code conditionally, this is the right answer!</p>
        </li>
        <li data-id="timer" data-button="Next">
            <p>Answer carefully, wrong answers will hurt your score, but answer quickly, becuase the more answers you get right before this timer runs out, the higher your score!</p>
        </li>
        <li data-button="Start the game!">
            <p>Questions will be a mix from several different categories.  You may be asked to match a snipped of code to the language it's written in, match some real world scenario to the data structure that naturally represents it, or identify an object oriented design principle.</p>
            <p>Competition will be fierce, and the game moves fast, so take a moment, focus, and get ready to start!</p>
